# Lab 2: Simple Chat Client Using PHP & MySQL

Let's get some practice using PHP's PDO object to query and insert items into a
database. We will build a simple chat client for this lab that will allow you
to send and receive messages with your classmates!

## User Interface & Interactions

For the first part of this assignment, we will begin with a simple UI. When
users enter the chat, they should be able to see the last 10 messages sent.
Each message entry should display the nickname of the sender, the content of
the message, and the date/time in which it was sent.

Below the message list, provide the user with a textbox to specify a nickname
to send the messages with, and a textarea for the contents of the message.
The user should be able to send the message by pressing the enter key or
by clicking a "send" button.
